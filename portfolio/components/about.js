                    After researching various career options, I found web development to be the most appealing. Despite my father&apos;s concern that AI might eventually take over the field, my strict Asian parents were supportive when they saw my dedication. They encouraged me to attend a bootcamp, which led me to conduct extensive research before settling on Codesmith. You can find more info <a href='https://www.codesmith.io/' target='_blank'>here</a>.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Before even being admitted to Codesmith, I had already built a dice game using React and React hooks, useState and useEffect. Despite my initial achievements, I knew that there was still so much more to learn. The rigorous selection process at Codesmith, which included multiple interviews and workshops, taught me valuable skills such as object-oriented programming, recursion, and permutations. It is worth noting that many admitted students often have some experience in the field already.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    During my time at Codesmith, every single day felt like a new learning opportunity. I quickly learned about Redux, backend development, testing with Jest, and more. After mastering the foundational concepts, we entered the project phase where I worked alongside other developers in a timed environment, often being given just two days to create something cool. It was through this experience that I really got to reinforce my understanding of what it meant to be a full stack developer working in a team. My most notable achievement was contributing to an open-source product with a team of 4 for a couple months, which you can find more about <Link to='experience' smooth={true} style={{cursor: 'pointer', textDecoration: 'underline'}} offset={-120}>here</Link>.

                    Looking back, I am amazed at how far I&apos;ve come on this journey. However, my passion for coding and learning remains strong. I am eager to explore new areas such as machine learning, game development, and creating tools for others. The future is full of exciting opportunities and I can&apos;t wait to see what&apos;s next!
