My team and I listed out project ideas that we all wanted to build out and voted on which ideas we thought were the best. We all had interests in games, and programming so we created a game to reward programmers for studying! Unfortunately I can&apos;t get all the features to work on this page, but you can check out the code ðŸ‘‰ <a href='https://github.com/Panda-Pets/Coding-Companion' target='_blank'>here</a> ðŸ‘ˆ
